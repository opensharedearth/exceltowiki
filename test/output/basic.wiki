|<p><b>1 Scope </b></p><p><b>1.1 General </b></p><p>This document specifies requirements and gives recommendations for six classes of well cements, and two classes of composite well cements including their chemical and physical requirements, and procedures for physical testing. </p><p> This specification is applicable to well cement classes A, B, C, and D, which are the products obtained by grinding Portland cement clinker and, if needed, calcium sulfate (CaSO4) as an interground additive. Processing additives can be used in the manufacture of cement of these classes. Suitable set-modifying agents can be interground or blended during the manufacture of Class D cement. Annex B describes composite well cement classes K and L, which are the products obtained by intergrinding Portland cement clinker and one or more forms of CaSO4 with composite constituents, or by subsequent blending of separately produced Portland cement with separately processed composite constituents. Composite constituents are also specified in Annex B. </p><p> This specification is also applicable to well cement classes G and H, which are the products obtained by grinding clinker with no additives other than one or more forms of CaSO4, water, or chemical additives as required for chromium (VI) reduction. </p><p><b>1.2 Application of the API Monogram </b></p><p>When product is manufactured at a facility licensed by API and is intended to be supplied bearing the API Monogram, the requirements of Annex A shall apply. </p><p><b>1.3 Use of Metric SI and US Customary Units</b></p><p>This document contains metric SI and US customary oilfield units. For the purposes of this document, the conversion between the systems is not exact and has been intentionally rounded to allow for ease of use in calibration and measurement.</p>
